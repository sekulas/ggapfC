# What is ggapfC
GGAPF - Graph Generator And Path Finder - JIMP project (Programming Languages and Methods course).
ggapfC is a project which was created during 2nd term of my CS studies, there is also an upgraded version of this project written in JAVA with GUI (javaFX), which uses MAVEN (https://github.com/ochnios/ggapf)
## What you can do with ggapfC
1. generate a graph with a given number of columns and rows of nodes and weights of random edges in a given range of values.
2. save such a graph to a file with a fixed format
3. read such a graph from a fixed-format file
4. check if a given graph is consistent (BFS algorithm)
5. find in a graph the shortest paths between selected pairs of nodes, using the Dijkstra algorithm
6. cut connected graph into declared amount of connected graphs
